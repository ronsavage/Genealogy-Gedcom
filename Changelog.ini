- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::SPEC.
- Remove the HTML templates called rainbow*, because they were never used.
- Update pre-preqs' version #s, especially for DateTime and DateTime::Infinite, to see if that fixes
mysterious CPAN Tester failures with t/date.t's use of '15 Jul 1954'.
Also, we now require Genealogy::Gedcom::Date V 1.08, which has the same DateTime pre-reqs.
