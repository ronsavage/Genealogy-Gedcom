Revision history for Perl extension Genealogy::Gedcom.

0.84  Unreleased
	- Add data/sample.6.ged to match data/sample.5.ged, to cover the 2 case of dates within the header.
		One case (sample.5.ged) allows a TIME, and the other does not.

0.83  Wed Jun 26 10:56:00 2013
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::SPEC.
	- Remove the HTML templates called rainbow*, because they were never used.
	- Update pre-preqs' version #s, especially for DateTime and DateTime::Infinite, to see if that fixes
		mysterious CPAN Tester failures with t/date.t's use of '15 Jul 1954'.
		Also, we now require Genealogy::Gedcom::Date V 1.08, which has the same DateTime pre-reqs.

0.82  Mon Feb 27 13:33:00 2012
	- The switch in V 0.81 from DateTime::Format::Gedcom to Genealogy::Gedcom::Date omitted some edits in t/*.t.

0.81  Thu Sep 29 14:48:00 2011
	- Switch pre-req from DateTime::Format::Gedcom V 1.01 to Genealogy::Gedcom::Date V 1.00.
	- Update UUID proposal with use case.
	- Rename UUID proposal from docs/uuid.txt to docs/uuid.proposal.pod, and add docs/uuid.proposal.html.
	- Remove obsolete docs/rationale.*.
	- In the array of hashrefs recording lex results, the type field can now be 'Date' or 'Invalid date'.
		'Date' means it was successfully parsed, and 'Invalid date' means it could not be parsed.

0.80  Mon Aug 29 12:00:00 2011
	- Initial release.
